    <p>My name is Nan Xie. I’m intended to double major in business with a track in marketing and Computer Science. I am a first-year student at University of Rochester. I’m 19 years old and have 2 younger siblings. My brother is a freshman in Highschool and my sister is a one year old. I’m been running track for more than 10 years and I currently run for the school team. My favorite food is everything that’s edible. I eat anything and everything because I’m not a picky eater. I don’t have any pets, but I would really love a dog or a cat.
