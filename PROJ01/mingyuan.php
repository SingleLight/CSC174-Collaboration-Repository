    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I'm an undergrad student at University of Rochester in the department of Computer Science, with interests in Philosophy and Economics.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm taking this course concurrently with CSC210 (Web Programming) and hopefully would get a good grasp on what web development is about.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have been working as free lancing translator and proofreader for various channels and software in the past.
        They includes videos from the YouTube channel "LinusTechTips" and app localization of Telegram.
        I have also worked as an English tutor and subway guide while I was in high school.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm an avid video game player ever since I first got in touch with a computer.
        My favourite game currently is League of Legends. I'm an ADC and support main.
        Please feel free to hook me up in games. My in-game username is Mr Pointy Hat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides video games, I also enjoy playing real games like badminton and table tennis,
        albeit much more casually. I'm also members of the UR badminton and table tennis clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well I cannot think of anything else to write here. So, I'll just make a list of my PC setup to share with my fellow PC gaming nerds:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Core-i7 9700K</li>
        <li>Gigabyte GTX 2080Ti</li>
        <li>G.Skill 32G RAM</li>
        <li>Asrock Z390 Taichi</li>
        <li>EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G3</li>
    </ul>
