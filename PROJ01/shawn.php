<p>My name is Shawn. I’m Chinese and also 1/4 British so you might notice my accent being “Australian” as a lot of people in the states recognize the juxtaposition of American and British accent being very Aussie. My major in U of R is Environmental Study and economics but I feel like taking some computer science class would be quite efficacious for my future career and this is exactly why I took csc170 and take csc174 now.</p>
